# EEE3088F-Micro-Mouse-Project-2025
# The Micromouse Robot Project for EEE3088F is about developing, building, and coding an autonomous robot to make its way through a maze. There are three primary subsystems in the system: the Processor Subsystem, Power Submodule, and Sensing Subsystem. The Processor, designed around an STM32 microcontroller, is responsible for controlling motor operation through PWM signals, reading the sensors, making decisions regarding navigation, and communicating with other modules. Power Submodule is crucial in its function of managing and supplying stable 3.3V and 5V voltages to the Processor and Sensing Subsystem, battery voltage monitoring using I2C, taking in PWM control inputs for motor driving, and external load switching. The Sensing Subsystem, primarily comprising Time-of-Flight (ToF) sensors, provides real-time range data important for path optimization and maze navigation. System design ensures the transmission of PWM and I2C control signals from Processor to Power Submodule and return of regulated voltage supplies to it. The Power Submodule provides stable voltages to the Sensing Subsystem directly. Proper ground referencing, stable power delivery, proper motor control, and proper communication with sensors are ensured throughout the entire project. Future enhancements could include advanced maze-solving algorithms, enhanced battery life management, or wireless communications integration. This project illustrates real-world embedded systems integration, hardware design, and algorithmic problem-solving with a solid learning experience in robotics and mechatronics.
